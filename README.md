<p align="center">I'm freelance developer **front-end**. I worked during 2 years in a web agency.       
 I had planned to travel in 2020 but because of the covid I travel from my sofa ! Sometimes I play at ACNH, TFT, LoL</p>


ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **React & GSAP**     
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with designers    
âš¡ Fun fact: I have an insta food !
