I'm freelance developer front-end. I worked during 2 years in a web agency.    
I had planned to travel in 2020 but because of the covid I travel from my sofa ! Sometimes I play at ACNH, TFT, LoL


ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React & GSAP     
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with designers    
âš¡ Fun fact: I have an insta food !
